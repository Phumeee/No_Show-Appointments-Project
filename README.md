# No_Show-Appointments-Project
This was my first project during the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. I investigated the No_Show Appointments dataset, which contains information on the medical appointments for 110,527 patients in Brazil. My goal was to ascertain the factors that affect the ability of the patients to show up for their scheduled appointments.
